        <h1>Women and Black Americans More Likely to be Diagnosed with Food Allergies</h1>
        <h2>Although food allergies are relatively uncommon, there are disparities among disagnosed groups.</h2>
        <h3>By Haley Parsley</h3>
        <p>
            CDC data from 2021 shows that only 6% of Americans are diagnosed with food allergies. This is a relatively
            small amount: comparatively, 26% of Americans are diagnosed with seasonal allergies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CDC's data about who experiences food allergies reveals gender and racial disparities in diagnosis
            rates. Notably, women are diagnosed with food allergies at twice the rate of men. And 8.5% of Black
            Americans are diagnosed with food allergies. This number falls to 6.2% for white Americans. And for Asian
            and Hispanic Americans, the rate of diagnosis is even lowerâ€” under 5%.
        </p>

        <p>
            What accounts for these disparities? In reporting this story, I would speak to the researchers behind this
            data, as well as other experts in the U.S., to learn more.
