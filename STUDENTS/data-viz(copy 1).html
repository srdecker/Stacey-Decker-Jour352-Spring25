        <h1>How Does the New York Mets' Success Affect Their Attendance?</h1>
        <h2>Analyzing Home Attendance and Wins Each of the Past 10 Years</h2>
        <h3>By Jake Kauderer</h3>
        <p>
            The charts — which show average home attendance and total wins over each of the past 10 years — convey how
            fans generally show up more when the Mets are successful. Their highest attendance came in 2016, a year they
            earned a playoff berth and the year after they went to the World Series. Attendance was low in 2018, when
            the Mets finished with just 77 wins. An exception is last season, when the Mets won a strong 89 games but
            finished with much lower attendance than 2023, a year they won only 75 games.
